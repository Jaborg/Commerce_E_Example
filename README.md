# Commerce_E_Example

To design a real-time data processing system for an e-commerce platform. Every time a sale occurs, an event is produced. 
The goal is to process this event to gather insights such as sales trends, hot products, etc., and the processed data 
can be used for both real-time dashboards and further batch processing using Apache Airflow.
